				<p>
					My name is Alexander Okoli, and I'm currently attaining a Master's degree in Software Engineering from Loyola University
					Chicago. My expected graduation is in December 2014. 
					<br />
					<br />
					Prior to embarking on my Software Engineering journey, I worked in the professional services industry, at KPMG Chicago. 
					I performed Transfer Pricing and Business Valuation consultation services for clients in various industries. Along the way, I developed
					an interest in software development and decided to pursue it professionally. This newfound interest led to my current enrollment
					at Loyola Chicago, and upon graduation, I plan to take on the role of a professional software developer. This site (created by me) 
					serves as a portfolio, showcasing some of my software projects, as well as my technical skills, so please feel free to explore!
